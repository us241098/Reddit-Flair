# MIDAS Task


This repository contains code for MIDAS internship task. The task is divided into 5 subtasks:

  - Data Collection
  - EDA
  - Data Cleaning & Modelling
  - Web Service
  - Deployment

## Data Collection
I have used `pushshift` [API](https://github.com/pushshift/api) instead of `PRAW` for this task as using this we can scrape more and older articles than using the `PRAW`. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/8qx7t7/why_does_praw_limit_number_of_submissions_for/) 
  - Using `pushshift` I have scraped around ~4 lakh submissions from: January 10 2018 to April 10 2020

## Web Service
A web service to know the flair of the submissions is developed using flask, I have used the saved model and weights to make the predictions. It consists of 2 endpoints:
  - `/`: visiting this page renders a HTML page where user can post the link of the submission and on submitting, predicted flair will be displayed. Working: Using the link entered the backend search for the post with the same URL using the `PRAW` after getting the submission we get the `selftext` and `title` from it and use the concatenated text for the prediction.
  
  - `/automated_testing`: This gives the predicted flairs for the links in a txt file. Provided file is uploaded like this 
    `files = {'upload_file': open('file.txt','rb')}`
    `r = requests.post(url, files=files)
